            <p>My name is Mawuli Ayikpa.I am from Ghana and was born in a town called Battor in the eastern part of Ghana. I enjoy watching football. It is my wish to become one of the best Software developer. One of my favarite scriptures is Mathew chapter 7:7 which says, Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asked receive it; and he that seek find it; and to him that knocked, it shall be opened. </p>
